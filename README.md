Proposed Solution :
--------------------
 *)The ‘Tech quiz’ project developed to overcome the time consuming problem of manual system. Apart from that in current system, checking the answer sheets after taking test,   waste the examiners time, so this application will check the correct answer and save the examiner time and carry the examination in an effective manner. The users which are use this system don’t need to high computing knowledge and also system will inform them while entering invalid data.
     
Scope :
----------
 *)Tech quiz allow for a standardised evaluation of the kind of information that stood out the most during lessons and allow for a quick data review. From the teaching      standpoint, the evaluation takes less time and can be graded quickly using software programmes or physical machines. Since each question has a limited number of points, there is scope to ask many. This means much can be covered in the paper.
 *)tech quiz is future technique towards their goals.
